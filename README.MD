Our team has been tasked with designing a CLI application to simulate a Health and Fitness Club Management System. The Fitness Club Management System will be able to get preset or new data from the database for a member, trainer or administrator. It will provide real-time feedback on the available data then we have functions to for a member to join the club, sign up for a session with their goals and current metrics and choose a trainer. They also get to update their profile, set up a nutrition log to match their goals and leave feedback for the trainers. The trainer gets to set their availability and choose which clients to accept. They also get to view the member's workout plans and can set up a custom workout plan for them. The administrator is in charge of the booking and payment system, monitoring the equipment maintenance dates, viewing and modifying the current class schedules.
